		 <p>thewrktb Nearly two-thirds of the

		 to heat stress bad enough to trigger 
		 bleaching over the past year, the leading 
		 agency monitoring coral reefs said on
		 Thursday. The U.S. National Oceanic and
		 Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced
		 last month that the world's coral reefs
		 were in the throes of a fourth mass 
		 bleaching event, as climate change combined
		 with an El Nino climate pattern has pushed 
		 ocean temperatures to record highs.Now, 
		 the agency reports some 60.5% of the world's
		 reef area has been affected and that 
		 number is still rising."I am very worried 
		 about the state of the world's coral 
		 reefs," NOAA's Coral Reef Watch 
		 coordinator Derek Manzello said in a 
		 monthly briefing. "We are seeing (ocean
		 temperatures) play out right now that are
		 very extreme in nature". Triggered by 
		 heat stress, coral bleaching occurs 
		 when corals expel the colourful algae 
		 living in their tissues. Without these 
		 helpful algae, the corals become pale 
		 and are vulnerable to starvation and 
		 disease.Scientists have documented mass
		 bleaching in at least 62 countries and 
		 territories, with India and Sri Lanka
		 recently reporting impacts.</P>
